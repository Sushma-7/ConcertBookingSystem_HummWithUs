    <h2>A.R Rhamna has been a successful music producer and composer in India for a very long time; but, like most people, I only became exposed to his music through his composition for the movie Slumdog Millionaire. The very same composition and production that won him two grammy’s for Best Compilation Soundtrack album and Best Song Written for Visual Media. On top of all his production success for films, he is also a live performer, and following the success of Slumdog Millionaire, he traveled the world to do his live performances.

        His Los Angeles show was at the Hollywood Bowl, which happen to be a great setting for his music. In the middle of July the summer night was perfect, slightly crisp but warm enough to be completely comfortable.</h2>
